# Project Musti

A schoolproject made by 5 students; [Maarten Eylenbosch](https://github.com/MaartenEylenbosch), [Laura Render](https://github.com/laurarenders), [Dylan Cluyse](https://github.com/dylancluyse), [Szymon Vertenten](https://github.com/SzymonVertenten) and [Joran Van Belle](https://github.com/JoranVanBelle)
We had to create several classifiers to determine wheter the cat, called Musti, in inside, outside or not on the image.

## Start the local server
To run the search engine, you need to start the server.py-file from the directory prediction.

## Visit the webpage
After you started the server, you can surf to localhost:5000/picture, where you can see the status of Musti.

## Usage
By clicking on the button "Take picture", you get a random picture to predict if Musti is visible.
By clicking the button "Retrain the model", you can retrain the model.

## goal
If the cat was not on the image or we scored to low with the accuracy, we had to take the next image.
